Iâ€™m an Asst. Professor of Computer Science at the Open University of Israel, and head of the OpenU AI Research group.

My research interests are mainly in:
- Deep learning, machine learning and its applications in computer vision, natural language understanding, recommender systems, speech & audio processing, and financial forecasting.
- Explainble AI and fairness: how to explain predictions made by AI models, and how to make these models more intrepretable, transparent, and fair.
